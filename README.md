# INM707 Deep Learning

## Installation

This project requires [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines). Follow installation steps in linked project - can skip installation of tensorflow as this is already included in the project dependencies.

Potential Next Steps:
- Try and implement https://github.com/MorvanZhou/pytorch-A3C on the CartPole and Pendulum examples. (Weekend?)
- Understand difference between Discrete and Contineous (Weekend?)
Research A3C better
- We need to decide on a game: https://github.com/openai/retro/tree/master/retro/data/stable
  - There are built in ROMs, or we have to source one ourselves - providing that there is an integration for the game already

Further:
- Adapt scripts to work over a different game (within openAI)
- Try different parameters
- Try different NN architecture

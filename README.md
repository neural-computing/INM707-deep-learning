# INM707 Deep Learning

This repo contains various different approaches to train an agent to play the [Atari 2600 Boxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_(Atari_2600)) game.

Models considered here are a Vanilla DQN using Replay Memory and MSE temporal difference loss, and a Duelling DQN using Prioritised Replay Memory, Huber loss, and a separate "target network".
